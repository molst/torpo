torpo is a basic utility library with minimal dependencies

## Getting Started

Sorry, no docs yet.

## Project Maturity

Developed primarily for my personal use. Anything can change without notice.

## Artifacts

[on Clojars](https://clojars.org/torpo). If you are using Maven, add the following repository
definition to your `pom.xml`:

``` xml
<repository>
  <id>clojars.org</id>
  <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```

With Leiningen:
```
[torpo "0.1"]
```
